The constellation of Ollie the Owl has suddenly started dominating the southern hemisphere, as shown above.  The constellation is taking the place of Wrinkles the Rhinoceros, who was unexpectedly voted off the sky by the other constellations.  Happy April Fools day from the folks at APOD!  Pictured above, a bird was photographed taking the Tololo All Sky Camera (TASCA) as a perch, a situation that would be even funnier if the bird's talons hadn't scratched the plastic enclosing dome.  TASCA continues to monitor the entire night sky as visible from the Cerro Tololo Inter-american Observatory located in Chile.  Given the unusual vantage point, one guess is that the bird is a Great Horned Owl, although it is hoped that a properly under-schooled ornithologist can e-mail Dr. Schwarz with the bird's true species.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0304/bird_tasca_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A New Constellation Takes Hold","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0304/bird_tasca.jpg"],["copyright":"J. Hendrickson","date":"1996-09-19","explanation":"A clear blue summer sky finally grows dark and the new telescope, hastily set up in the backyard, generates excitment and anticipation. \"I bought it for the kids ...\", Dad assures himself as he over-anxiously supervises the two young boys' efforts to center a bright, first quarter Moon, in the finder. The evening's first target acquired, James adjusts the focus knob and falls silent. Suddenly, \"Wow, looks just like on Apollo 13!\". His younger brother Christopher takes his turn. \"Do you see the Moon?\", James asks, eager to provide guidance based on his own observing experience. Christopher echoes his brother's enthusiasm, \"Yes, and I see all the crashes too!\". The view they shared was not too different from the above image of a six day old moon, recorded in July 1995 by Rhode Island amateur astronomer Jim Hendrickson. Along the terminator, the line between lunar night and day, the shadows outline to advantage the spectacular craters -- caused by all the crashes.

Known as R136, the cluster's energetic stars are breaking out of the cocoon of gas and dust from which they formed. This disintegrating cocoon, which fills the rest of the recently released above picture by the Hubble Space Telescope, is predominantly ionized hydrogen from 30 Doradus. R136 is composed of thousands of hot blue stars, some about 50 times more massive than our Sun.  R136, also known as NGC 2070, lies in the LMC - a satellite galaxy to our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Although the young ages of stars in R136 make it similar to a Milky Way open cluster, its high density of stars will likely turn it into a low mass globular cluster in a few billion years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0107/30Doradus_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Star Cluster R136 Bursts Out","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0107/30Doradus_hst.jpg"],["date":"1998-03-02","explanation":"In a meeting in California two weeks ago, unpublished results were presented indicating that most of the energy in our universe is not in stars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  In the language of cosmologists, a large cosmological constant is directly implied by new distant supernovae observations. Suggestions of a cosmological constant (lambda) are not new -- they have existed since the advent of modern relativistic cosmology. Such claims are not usually popular with astronomers, though, because lambda is so unlike known universe components, because lambda's value appears limited by observations, and because less-strange cosmologies without lambda have historically done well in explaining the data.  Therefore most lamdba claims do not make the News Summary in a prestigious journal like Science.  What is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations, and the good reputations of the scientists conducting the investigation. The   above picture of a supernova at redshift 0.5 in a spiral galaxy, was taken by this collaboration. However, two teams of scientists are independently studying distant supernovae, and the last official word from the other team was a result consistent with no cosmological constant, reported just two months ago.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so cosmologists the world over eagerly await peer-reviewed results, further details, and more data.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9803/snhighz_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rumors of a Strange Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9803/snhighz_hst.jpg"],["date":"1998-03-23","explanation":"The center of galaxy NGC 1808 is bursting with new stars, but why? Being a barred spiral galaxy makes NGC 1808 somewhat similar to our own Milky Way Galaxy.  But the disk of NGC 1808 (inset) is quite warped, and its center is unusually bright and blue. The above picture of NGC 1808's center, in representative color, was recently taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and released yesterday. Perhaps gravitational pull from a recent pass of neighboring galaxy NGC 1792 has caused matter to move inward along NGC 1808's bar, triggering the burst of star formation.  Also prominent are blue clusters of stars and filaments of dark dust obscuring even more activity.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9803/ngc1808_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Starbirth in NGC 1808","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9803/ngc1808_hst.jpg"]]
